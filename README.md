# Excess risk of heat-related hospitalization associated with temperature and PM2.5 among older adults

This repository contains code to merge temperature, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and Medicare data, set up a case-crossover design, fit Bayesian conditional logistic regression models, and estimate the independent and synergistic effects of temperature and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures on heat-related hospitalization.
